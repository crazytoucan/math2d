/**
 * Determines the closest the ray comes to a given reference point
 *
 * If the point lies on the positive side of the ray (_t_ â‰¥ 0), this function
 * finds the projection of the point onto the ray's geometry.
 * If the point lies on the negative side of the ray (_t_ < 0),
 * this function returns the ray's initial point.
 *
 * This function returns the squared distance in the result's `distanceValue`.
 * This is preferred over returning the (non-squared) distance because points
 * behind the ray need to measure distance to the ray's initial point, which would otherwise involve a square root.
 * If you know the point lies in front of the ray, and want to measure the distance while avoiding a square
 * root, prefer {@link lineNearestDistanceToPoint}. To determine which side of the ray a point lies on,
 * see {@link lineProjectPoint}.
 *
 * @param ray the ray to inspect
 * @param point the reference point to project onto the ray
 * @param out
