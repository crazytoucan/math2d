# math2d

Two dimensional vector math library for JavaScript.
Built for performance in computation-heavy real-time engines without sacrificing usability.
Supports tree shaking and dead code removal to avoid bloating client-side bundles.
Zero dependencies.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ yarn add math2d
```

```ts
import { _vec, mat2dFromRotation, vecTransformBy } from "math2d";

const threeFour = _vec(3, 4);
const spin = mat2dFromRotation(Math.PI / 4);
console.log(vecTransformBy(threeFour, spin));
```
